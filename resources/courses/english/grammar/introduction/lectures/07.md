### Terminators

How would you say "the person promises a friend that the dog gives"? With the vocabulary that has been taught so far, you can't, at least not without moving sumti places around. _lo prenu cu nupre lo nu lo gerku cu dunda lo pendo_ doesn't work. _lo gerku_ ends up inside the _lo nu_ abstraction in dunda's x_2 place, which implies the dog is giving a friend as a gift, which is not what is meant.

You could rearrange the sentence to put the abstraction sumti at the end: _lo prenu cu nupre fi lo pendo fe lo nu lo gerku cu dunda_. This works here, but not always. For example you wanted to put three abstraction sumti in a sentence, you're out of luck, because you have to put two next to each other, not separated by the _cu <SELBRI/>_.  Also, having to always re-arrange sentences like this can be tedious.

To solve this, Lojban has cmavo called famyma'o, or "terminators" in English. These allow you to close off any grammatical structure, so you can place a sumti after an abstraction without putting it inside the abstraction by closing it with the famyma'o _kei_.

<span class="definition-head">kei</span> elidable terminator: end abstraction bridi

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
| lo prenu cu nupre lo nu lo gerku cu dunda kei lo pendo | A person promises a friend that the dog gives |

For completeness, there's two other famyma'o for grammatical constructs that we've learned so far. They are _ku_ for description sumti and _vau_ for trailing sumti after the selbri.

<span class="definition-head">ku</span> elidable terminator: end description

<span class="definition-head">vau</span> famyma'o: terminates bridi.

### Terminator elision

The reason that you've not seen any of these words before is because Lojban allows for famyma'o to be elided (skipped). Terminators act like right parentheses, except that if the sentence would not parse with them, they are added from the inside out until the sentence parses.  Consider this example with actual brackets

```
a(b{c[d(e f} g 
```

We can actually deduce that the balanced version must be:

```
a(b{c[d(e f)]} g)
```

It would not make sense any other way. Terminators in Lojban work the same way, except grammatical constructs are the opening brackets, and terminators are the closing brackets. If elided, a terminator is treated as being in its rightmost possible position.

Lojbanists rely on this feature constantly. Most sentences produced by proficient users of the language include no redundant (rightmost position) terminators at all. Lojban speakers do not think of elision as the exception to a rule of including all terminators, they think of terminator inclusion as a way to avoid undesirable sentence structure.

_cu_ means the main verb comes next, so all the precededing nouns and abstractions must be terminated.

Lojban sentences with all redundant terminators included can get very long, consider the sentence from the top of this page, for example:

| All terminators without cu | Minimal terminators + cu |
|--------|-----------|
| lo prenu ku nupre lo nu lo gerku ku dunda vau kei ku lo pendo ku vau | lo prenu cu nupre lo nu lo gerku cu dunda kei lo pendo |

Imagine needing to say all that! Additionally, this pair of sentences demonstrates how much clearer marking the start of a selbri is compared to the end of every sumti. There's only one selbri per clause but potentially many sumti. The start of a selbri is a much more important structural boundary than the end of the sumti before it.

Terminator usage may seem difficult, but it gets easier with practice.

### Exercises

It's now time for you to attempt a few more translations.

Translate the following sentences from English into Lojban, making sure you include terminators where necessary:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|What did you promise to write?|<span class="spoiler-answer">do nupre lo nu ciska ma</span>|
|Are you happy that I promised to donate the cat?|<span class="spoiler-answer">xu do gleki lo nu mi nupre lo nu dunda lo mlatu</span>|
|I promised you that the person would say that the cat is beautiful.|<span class="spoiler-answer">mi nupre lo nu lo prenu cu cusku lo se du'u lo mlatu cu melbi kei kei do<br/><br/>Or: mi nupre fi do fe lo nu lo prenu cu cusku lo se du'u lo mlatu cu melbi</span>|

### Practice

As usual, before proceeding to the next lesson, get some practice with interactive exercises &ndash; look for the "Practice" button nearby!

Beware that exercises loop indefinitely, so feel free to stop once you feel you've had enough.
And be sure to revisit exercises on different days, to benefit from the spacing effect.

### Notice

This chapter has been completely rewritten by la .samflir., .ziren. and la nalvai as part of a rework of Lojban.io's course to replace the "terminator-first" style of teaching used in the Wave Lessons with the "terminator-later" style used in Lojban For Beginners.

Other chapters have been modified to remove redundant terminators while keeping the content mostly the same. If you have feedback on this course's consistency or clarity regarding terminators, please ping la .samflir. in the [roljbogu'e Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/dGP5A6Fpj7) or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/jqueiroz/lojban.io).
