### Linked sumti

Let's start this lesson with two new words:

<span class="definition-head">bangu</span> x_1 is a/the language/dialect used by x_2 to express/communicate x_3 (si'o/du'u, not quote).

<span class="definition-head">cmene</span> x_1 (quoted word(s)) is a/the name/title/tag of x_2 to/used-by namer/name-user x_3 (person).

What if I wanted to say "my language", or "my name"?

You can probably see that the sumti _lo bangu poi mi se bangu ke'a_ is a less than elegant expression for "my language".
This is because it's really a workaround.
A language which I speak can be said to fill into the x_1 of the bridi _bangu mi_.
But we can't convert that to a sumti using just **lo..**, as in _lo bangu mi_.
The reason is that _lo_ only accepts selbri, and _bangu mi_ is a bridi, not a selbri.
Hence _lo bangu mi_ is actually two separate sumti, _lo bangu_ and _mi_.

What about **lo su'u..**?
We can't use that either, because the _su'u_ gives the bridi a new x_1, the abstraction, and the _lo_ then extracts that.
Hence _lo su'u {zo'e} bangu mi_ is an abstraction sumti meaning something like "that something is my language".

Enter _be_. _be_ is a word which binds constructs (sumti as well as others we'll later see) to a selbri.
Using it in ordinary selbri has no effect: in _mi nelci be do_, the _be_ does nothing.
However, when a sumti is bound to a selbri this way, you can use **lo..** on the selbri without the sumti splitting off: _lo bangu be mi_ is a correct solution to the problem above.
<!-- Likewise, you can attach a sumtcita: lo jinga be gau do: The one who wins because of you. -->

Let's see some examples:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|mi nelci lo cmene be do|I like your name.</span>|
|xu lo prenu cu tavla fo lo bangu be do|Is the person talking in your language?</span>|
|mi tavla fi lo se nupre be do|I talked about your promise.</span>|

What if I want to attach several sumti to a selbri inside **lo..**?
"The giver of the apple to you" is _lo dunda be lo plise be do_, right?
Nope.
The second _be_ attaches to the apple, meaning _lo plise be do_ &ndash; "the apple of the strain of you", which makes no sense.
In order to string several sumti to a selbri, all the ones following the first must be bound with _bei_.
The binding can be terminated with _be'o_ &ndash; one instance of _be'o_ for each selbri which has sumti bound by _be_.

Here are the definitions:

<span class="definition-head">be</span> binds sumti or sumtcita to selbri.

<span class="definition-head">bei</span> binds a second, third, fourth (etc) sumti or sumtcita to a selbri.

<span class="definition-head">be'o</span> ends binding to selbri.

And a few more examples:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|mi pendo lo pilno be lo skami bei lo nu ctuca|I am a friend of the user of computers for teaching.|
|mi tavla fi lo se nupre be do bei lo ctuca|I talked about the promise you made to the teacher.|
|mi tavla lo sutra be lo nu vecnu|I talked to the (one who is) fast in selling.|

Note that the last sentence could have been written more concisely as a tanru, with almost zero precision loss: _mi tavla lo sutra vecnu_.
<!-- In lojban, ... -->


### Exercises

<!-- TODO: write some sentences -->
<!-- do do -->
Now it's your turn.
Translate the following sentences from Lojban into English:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|mi nelci lo pendo be do|<span class="spoiler-answer">I like your friend.</span>|
|lo vecnu be lo skami cu pendo|<span class="spoiler-answer">The seller of computers is friendly.</span>|
|mi ciska lo cmene be lo pilno be lo skami|<span class="spoiler-answer">I wrote the name of the user of computers.</span>|

Now, translate the following sentences from English into Lojban:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|My friend likes sellers of apples.|<span class="spoiler-answer">lo pendo be mi cu nelci lo vecnu be lo plise</span>|
|Did you write your friend's promise?|<span class="spoiler-answer">xu do ciska lo se nupre be lo pendo be do</span>| <!-- Is this translation acceptable? -->
|I like your teaching method.|<span class="spoiler-answer">mi nelci lo xe ctuca be fu do</span>|

### Practice

As usual, before proceeding to the next lesson, get some practice with interactive exercises &ndash; look for the "Practice" button nearby!

Beware that exercises loop indefinitely, so feel free to stop once you feel you've had enough.
And be sure to revisit exercises on different days, to benefit from the spacing effect.
