### Morphology and word classes

Okay, we covered a lot of ground so far.
We mostly did that by focusing on immediately useful Lojbanic constructs for everyday usage, and then applying those constructs in exercises.
This lesson will be a bit different.
Instead of focusing on a single construct, we will cover the basics of Lojban morphology, as this knowledge will help you learn many other concepts down the road.

What is morphology?
The word is derived from Greek meaning the study of shapes, and in this context, it refers to how we make words from letters and sounds, as contrasted with syntax &ndash; how we make sentences with words.
Lojban operates with different morphological word classes, which are all defined by their morphology.
To make it all nice and systematic, words with certain functions tend to be grouped by morphological classes, though exceptions may occur.

|Class|Meaning|Defined By|Typical Function|
|-----|-------|----------|----------------|
|**Words:**||||
|brivla|Bridi-word.|Among first 5 letters (excluding ' ) is a consonant cluster. Ends in vowel.|Acts as a selbri by default. Always has a place structure.|
|\\___ gismu|Root-word.|5 letters of the form CVCCV or CCVCV.|One to five sumti places. Covers (arbitrarily chosen) basic concepts.|
|\\___ lujvo|Compound word. Derived from from lujvla, meaning complex word.|Min. 6 letters. Made by stringing rafsi together with binding letters if necessary.|Covers more concepts than gismu.|
|\\___ zi'evla|Free-word.|As brivla, but do not meet defining criteria of gismu or lujvo, ex: _angeli_ (angel).|Covers unique concepts like names of places or organisms.|
|cmevla|Name-word.|Beginning and ending with pause (full stop). Last sound/letter is a consonant.|Always acts as a name or as the content of a quote.|
|cmavo|Grammar-word. From cmavla, meaning small word.|One consonant or zero, always at the beginning. Ends in a vowel.|Grammatical functions. Varies.|
|**Word fragments:**||||
|rafsi|Affix.|CCV, CVC, CV'V, -CVCCV, -CCVCV, CVCCy- or CCVCy-.|Not actual words, but can be stringed together to form lujvo.|

Let's go through each word class:

* **cmevla** are very easy to identify because they begin and end with a pause, signaled by a full stop in writing, and the last letter is a consonant. Cmevla have two functions: they can either act as a proper name, if prefixed by the article **la** (explained in next lesson); or they can act as the content of a quote. One can mark stress in the names by capitalizing the letters which are stressed. Examples of cmevla are: _.io'AN._ (Johan), _.mat._ (Matt), _.djan._ (John) and _.cumindzyn._ (Xuming Zeng). Names which do not end in consonants need to have one added: _.anas._ (Anna); or removed: _.an._.
* **brivla** are called bridi-words because they by default are selbri, and therefore almost all Lojban words with a place structure are brivla. This has also given them the English nickname content-words. It's nearly impossible to say anything useful without brivla, and almost all words for concepts outside lojban grammar (and even most of the words for things in the language) are captured by brivla. As shown in the table, brivla has three subcategories:
  * **gismu** are the root words of the language. Only about 1450 exist, and very few new ones are added. They cover the most basic concepts like circle, friend, tree and dream. Examples include _prenu_, _pelxu_ and _dunda_.
  * **lujvo** are made by combining rafsi (see under rafsi), to cover more concepts than gismu alone. By combining rafsi, one narrows down the meaning of the word. Lujvo are made by an elaborate algorithm, so making valid lujvo on the fly is near impossible, with few exceptions like _selpa'i_, from _se prami_, which can only have one definition. Instead, lujvo are made once, its place structure defined, and then that definition is made official by the dictionary. Examples include _brivla_ (bridi-word), _jbobau_ (lojbanic-language = Lojban) and _cakcinki_ (shell-insect = beetle).
  * **zi'evla** are made by making up words which fit the definition for brivla, but not for lujvo or gismu. They tend to cover concepts which are hard to cover by lujvo, for instance names of species, nations or very culture-specific concepts. Examples include _xanguke_ (South Korea), _cidjrpitsa_ (pizza) and _.angeli_ (angel).
* **cmavo** are small words with one or zero consonants. They tend to not signify anything in the exterior world, but to have only grammatical function. Exceptions occur, and it's debatable how much attitudinals exist for their grammatical function. Another weird example are the words of the class **GOhA**, which act as brivla. It is valid to type several cmavo in a row as one word, as we previously mentioned. By grouping certain cmavo in functional units, though, it is sometimes easier to read. Thus, _uipuzuvukumi citka_ is valid, and is parsed and understood as _ui pu zu vu ku mi citka_. Like other Lojban words, one should (but need not always) place a full stop before any words beginning with a vowel.
  * cmavo of the form **xVV**, **CV'VV** or **V'VV** are experimental, and are words which are not in the official language definition, but which have been added by Lojban users to respond to a certain need.
* **rafsi** are not Lojban words, and can never appear alone. However, several (more than one) rafsi combine to form lujvo. These must still live up to the brivla-definition, for instance "lojban" is invalid because it ends in a consonant (which makes it a cmevla), and "ci'ekei" is invalid because it does not contain a consonant cluster, and is thus read as two cmavo written as one word. Often, a 3-4 letter string is both a cmavo and a rafsi, like _mu'i_, which is both the **BAI** and the rafsi for _mukti_. Note that there is nowhere that both a cmavo and a rafsi would be grammatical, so these are not considered homophones. All gismu can double as (word-final) rafsi, if they are prefixed with another rafsi. The first four letter of a gismu suffixed with an "y" can also act as a rafsi, if they are suffixed with another rafsi. The vowel "y" can only appear in lujvo or cmevla. Valid rafsi letter combinations are: CVV, CV'V, CCV, CVCCy- CCVCy-, -CVCCV and -CCVCV.

#### Practice

Now, try to infer the classification of a few words you are already familiar with:

|Word|Class|
|--------|-----------|
|mi|<span class="spoiler-answer">cmavo</span>|
|dunda|<span class="spoiler-answer">brivla (more specifically, gismu)</span>|
|.djan.|<span class="spoiler-answer">cmevla</span>|
|sedu'u|<span class="spoiler-answer">two words: se (cmavo) + du'u (cmavo)</span>|
|gau|<span class="spoiler-answer">cmavo (also rafsi for _gasnu_)</span>|
|melbi|<span class="spoiler-answer">brivla (more specifically, gismu)</span>|
|sepi'o|<span class="spoiler-answer">two words: se (cmavo) + pi'o (cmavo, and also rafsi for _pilno_)</span>|
|kei|<span class="spoiler-answer">cmavo</span>|

### Practice

As usual, before proceeding to the next lesson, get some practice with interactive exercises &ndash; look for the "Practice" button nearby!

Beware that exercises loop indefinitely, so feel free to stop once you feel you've had enough.
And be sure to revisit exercises on different days, to benefit from the spacing effect.
