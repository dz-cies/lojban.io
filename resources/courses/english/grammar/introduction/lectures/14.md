### Quotations 1

One of the key design features of Lojban is that it's supposed to be audio-visual isomorphic, meaning that everything expressed in text should also be expressed in speech and vice versa.
Therefore, there cannot be any punctuation which is not pronounced.
This means that Lojban has a wide range of words to quote other words.
All Lojban quotes take some input of text and converts it to a sumti.
Let's begin with the most simple:

<span class="definition-head">lu</span> Quote word: begin quote of grammatical Lojban content.

<span class="definition-head">li'u</span> Quote word: end quote of grammatical Lojban content.

The text inside this construct must by itself be grammatical.

Let's see some examples:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|do cusku lu mi nelci lo mlatu li'u|<span class="spoiler-answer">You said "I like cats".</span>|
|mi ciska lu vecnu lo skami li'u|<span class="spoiler-answer">I wrote "selling computers".</span>|
|mi fanva lu lo gerku cu melbi li'u|<span class="spoiler-answer">I translated "dogs are beautiful".</span>|

Note the difference between _do cusku lu mi nelci lo mlatu_ &ndash; "You said 'I like cats'", and _do cusku lo se du'u mi nelci lo mlatu_ &ndash; "You said that I like cats".
In the first case, it is _you_ who likes cats; in the second case, it is _me_.

These quote words, _lu_ and _li'u_, cannot quote ungrammatical text.
In future lessons, we will learn new words for quoting ungrammatical text.

What if you want to quote a single word?
For these cases, Lojban has a shorter syntax involving the word _zo_, which always quotes the next Lojban word, no matter what it is.
It's pretty handy.

<span class="definition-head">zo</span> Quote word: quotes next Lojban word, no matter what.

Here are some examples:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|do ciska zo mlatu|<span class="spoiler-answer">You wrote "cats" (or, well, "catness" or "being a cat", if that makes sense).</span>|
|mi cusku zo lu|<span class="spoiler-answer">I said "lu".</span>|
|fanva zo bangu fu ma|<span class="spoiler-answer">How does one translate "language"? &ndash; What is the translation of "language"?</span>|
|ma cusku zo zo|<span class="spoiler-answer">Who said "zo"?</span>|

### Practice

As usual, before proceeding to the next lesson, get some practice with interactive exercises &ndash; look for the "Practice" button nearby!

Beware that exercises loop indefinitely, so feel free to stop once you feel you've had enough.
And be sure to revisit exercises on different days, to benefit from the spacing effect.
