### Terminators

How would you say "The person teaches me that the house is yellow about a dog" (maybe the dog has a yellow house)? With the vocabulary that has been taught so far, you can't, at least not without moving sumti places around. _lo prenu cu ctuca mi lo du'u lo zdani cu pelxu lo gerku_ doesn't work. _lo gerku_ ends up inside the _lo du'u_ abstraction, in pelxu's nonexistent x_2 place. The fact that pelxu lacks an x_2 place doesn't matter to Lojban's grammar. It will let you fill places that don't exist.

You could rearrange the sentence to put the abstraction sumti at the end: _lo prenu cu ctuca mi fo lo gerku fi lo du'u lo zdani cu pelxu_. This works, but doesn't generalise. If you wanted to put three abstraction sumti in a sentence, you're out of luck, because you have to put two next to each other, not separated by the _cu <SELBRI/>_.

For the purpose of marking where grammatical constructs (such as abstractions) end, Lojban has cmavo called famyma'o, "terminators" in English. These allow you to close off any grammatical structure, so you can place a sumti after an abstraction without putting it inside the abstraction by using the famyma'o _kei_.

<span class="definition-head">kei</span> elidable terminator: end abstraction bridi

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|lo prenu cu ctuca mi lo du'u lo zdani cu pelxu kei lo gerku|The person teaches me that the house is yellow about the dog.|

For completeness, there's two other famyma'o for grammatical constructs that we've learned so far. They are _ku_ for description sumti and _vau_ for trailing sumti after the selbri (in that sense, it's a post-selbri counterpart to _cu_).

<span class="definition-head">ku</span> elidable terminator: end description

<span class="definition-head">vau</span> famyma'o: terminates bridi.

### Terminator elision

The reason that you've not seen any of these words before is because Lojban allows for famyma'o to be elided (skipped). By default, every Lojban grammar construct accepts a certain type of phrase, and any subsequent word that cannot be a part of that phrase auto-terminates it without requiring the famyma'o.

Put another way, the default position of a famyma'o is the rightmost possible one. The only reason you'd need to include an elidable famyma'o is because you're closing a grammatical construct earlier than it would otherwise, like in the top example sentence.

Lojbanists rely on this feature constantly. Most sentences produced by proficient users of the language include no redundant (rightmost position) terminators at all. Lojban speakers do not think of elision as the exception to a rule of including all terminators, they think of terminator inclusion as a way to avoid undesirable or incorrect sentence structure.

_cu_ closes off as many preceding grammatical constructs to get to the main selbri of whatever bridi or sub-bridi still doesn't have one yet.

Lojban sentences with all redundant terminators included can get very long, consider the sentence from the top of this page, for example:

|All terminators without cu|Minimal terminators + cu|
|--------|-----------|
|lo prenu ku ctuca mi lo du'u lo zdani ku pelxu vau kei ku lo gerku ku vau|lo prenu cu ctuca mi lo du'u lo zdani cu pelxu kei lo gerku|

Imagine needing to say all that! Additionally, this pair of sentences demonstrates how much clearer marking the start of a selbri is compared to the end of every sumti. There's only one selbri per clause but potentially many sumti. The start of a selbri is a much more important structural boundary than the end of the sumti before it.

Terminator usage may seem difficult, but it gets easier with practice.

### Exercises

It's now time for you to attempt a few more translations.

Translate the following sentences from English into Lojban, making sure you include terminators where necessary:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|What did you promise to write?|<span class="spoiler-answer">do nupre lo nu ciska ma</span>|
|Are you happy that I promised to donate the cat?|<span class="spoiler-answer">xu do gleki lo nu mi nupre lo nu dunda lo mlatu</span>|
|I promised you that the person would say that the cat is beautiful.|<span class="spoiler-answer">mi nupre lo nu lo prenu cu cusku lo se du'u lo mlatu cu melbi kei kei do<br/><br/>Or: mi nupre fi do fe lo nu lo prenu cu cusku lo se du'u lo mlatu cu melbi</span>|
