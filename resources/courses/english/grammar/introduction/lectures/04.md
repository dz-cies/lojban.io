### Transforming selbri
-->

<!--
The simplest type of selbri are those formed by a single word, such as the selbri _tavla_ inside the bridi _mi tavla do_.
In the previous lesson, you learned how to derive slightly more complex tanru using the words _se_, _te_, _ve_ and _re_.
In this lesson, you will learn yet another type of transformation: tanru.
-->

(there is no earlier lesson about brivla)

### Selbri and Brivla

Let's focus more in the selbri structure for now. 
Recall that, selbri is predicate relationship, for which it has sumti places: *some selbri = x_1 something x_2 something x_3 (and so on).*

The simplest type of selbri is the one formed by a single word: a brivla. For instance, **zdani**, **pelxu** are all examples of brivla.
So far, you've seen examples of selbri which were not form by simple brivla, for example: **se dunda**, where **dunda** is a brivla, and **se** is a cmavo.

When one combines two selbri, the result will be a tanru (which is a kind of selbri).
An example: **pelxu zdani** would be a **zdani** which is somehow **pelxu**-like or **pelxu**-related.
-->

### Simple tanru

In this lesson, you will become familiar with the concept of a tanru.
A tanru is formed when a selbri is put in front of another selbri, modifying its meaning.
<!--
A tanru is itself a selbri, and can combine with other selbri or tanru to form more complex tanru.
Thus _zdani vecnu_ is a tanru, as well as _pelxu zdani vecnu_, which is made from the tanru _pelxu zdani_ and the single brivla word _vecnu_.
-->
To understand the concept of tanru, consider the noun combination "lemon tree" in English.
If you didn't know what a lemon tree was, but had heard about both lemons and trees, you would not be able to deduce what a lemon tree was.
Perhaps a lemon-colored tree, or a tree shaped like a lemon, or a tree whose bark tastes like lemon.
The only things you could know for sure would be that it would be a tree, and it would be lemon-like in some way.

<!--
A tanru is closely analogous to this.
It cannot be said exactly what a _pelxu zdani_ is, but it can be said that it is definitely a _zdani_, and that it's _zdani_-like in some way.
And it could be _zdani_-like in any way.
In theory, no matter how silly or absurd the connection to zdani was, it could still truly be a _pelxu zdani_.
However, it must actually be a vecnu in the ordinary sense in order for the tanru to apply.
You could gloss zdani vecnu as home seller, or even better but worse sounding a home-type-of seller.
The place structure of a tanru is always that of the rightmost selbri.
It's also said that the left selbri modifies the right selbri.
-->

An example of a Lojbanic tanru would be the expression _pelxu zdani_, most likely meaning a house painted yellow.

<!--
We'll focus in a simple kind of tanru: two brivla tanru.
-->

<span class="definition-head">zdani</span> x_1 is a nest/house/lair/den/[home] of/for x_2.  (event/state).

<span class="definition-head">pelxu zdani</span> x_1 is a nest/house/lair/den/[home] (which is somehow **pelxu**-related) of/for x_2.  (event/state).

The connection between **pelxu** and **zdani** could be any: the houses are somehow related to yellow.
Perhaps they are painted in yellow color.
Or perhaps the word "yellow" is written on the front door, or perhaps there is a yellow volleyball in its patio.
Because the connection can be any, even silly things, there is no precise English equivalent of a tanru.
Of course, context is key, and you would never use _pelxu zdani_ to refer to a house containing a yellow volleyball unless you were really, really confident that the listener would pick up the intended meaning.

Take another example:

<span class="definition-head">gerku zdani</span> x_1 is a nest/house/lair/den/[home] (which is somehow **gerku**-related) of/for x_2.  (event/state).

In this example, the house is somehow connected to dogs.
Perhaps it is a dog's house.
Also, the order of the words is very important:

<span class="definition-head">zdani gerku</span> x_1 is a dog/canine/[bitch] (which is somehow **zdani**-related) of species/breed x_2. .  (event/state).

While **gerku zdani** is a house, **zdani gerku** is a dog.
What does **zdani gerku** mean, you ask?
Perhaps the dog has the shape of a house.
Or perhaps the dog always stays at his (or his owner's) house.
It's entirely open to interpretation (and context).

#### More examples

Let's have a few more examples of tanru:

<div class="translation-source">
ti melbi gerku
</div>
<div class="translation-target">
This is a beautiful dog.
</div>

Since tanru are selbri, they can be converted into sumti with the usual **lo**..**ku** construct.

<div class="translation-source">
mi nelci lo melbi mlatu ku
</div>
<div class="translation-target">
I like the beautiful cat.
</div>

It is also possible to form tanru using reordering with **se** and friends:

<div class="translation-source">
lo pelxu se dunda ku melbi mi
</div>
<div class="translation-target">
I find the yellow/golden gift to be beautiful.
</div>


#### Tanru versus filling sumti places

It is important to realize the difference in meaning between making a tanru and actually filling a sumti place.

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|ti zdani lo prenu ku|This is a house of/for a person.|
|ti prenu zdani|This is a house somehow related to a person. <br/> [perhaps] This is a house of/for a person. <br/> [perhaps] This is a house that has personality.|

Notice how, in the first example, we know for sure that it is a person's house, because "person" actually filled the x_2 sumti place for _zdani_.
In the second example, which uses a tanru, there is no way to be certain: the relation could be any.
It could be that this is a person's house.
It could be the house has a personality.
It could be the house has the shape of a person.
It could mean anything, as long as it has to do with person/personality.

In other words, if you are able to fill up the sumti place instead of constructing a tanru, it is generally advisable to do so for increased precision.
<!-- Unless you want to purposely be vague... or unless context leaves the meaning of a tanru very clear. -->

### Exercises

Your turn.
Try to translate the following sentences.
Try to use common sense to translate the tanru constructs, but keep in mind that alternative interpretations are perfectly valid as well.

<span class="definition-head">sutra</span> x_1 is fast/swift/quick/hastes/rapid at doing/being/bringing about x2 (event/state).

<span class="definition-head">lojbo</span> x_1 reflects [Loglandic]/Lojbanic language/culture/nationality/community in aspect x_2.

<span class="definition-head">ciska</span> x_1 inscribes/writes x_2 on display/storage medium x_3 with writing implement x_4; x1 is a scribe.

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|do sutra tavla fo lo lojbo ku|<span class="spoiler-answer">You talk quickly in Lojban.</span>|
|mi dunda lo pelxu zdani ku |<span class="spoiler-answer">I donated the yellow house.</span>|
|mi nelci lo sutra mlatu ku|<span class="spoiler-answer">I like fast cats.</span>|
|do mlatu ctuca lo prenu ku|<span class="spoiler-answer">You teach people in a cat-like manner.</span>|
|do pelxu ciska|<span class="spoiler-answer">You write in a yellow-like manner (perhaps using yellow ink).</span>|
|ti sutra se mlatu|<span class="spoiler-answer">This is a fast cat species.</span>|

Now, translate the following sentences from English into Lojban:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|This is a lojbanic cat.|<span class="spoiler-answer">ti lojbo mlatu</span>|
|I write in a lojbanic way.|<span class="spoiler-answer">mi lojbo ciska</span>|
|You donated a beautiful house.|<span class="spoiler-answer">do dunda lo melbi zdani ku</span>|
|The talking friend wrote something quickly.|<span class="spoiler-answer">lo tavla pendo ku sutra ciska</span>|
|I like the yellow gift.|<span class="spoiler-answer">mi nelci lo pelxu se dunda ku</span>|

### Practice

As usual, before proceeding to the next lesson, get some practice with interactive exercises &ndash; look for the "Practice" button nearby!

Beware that exercises loop indefinitely, so feel free to stop once you feel you've had enough.
And be sure to revisit exercises on different days, to benefit from the spacing effect.
